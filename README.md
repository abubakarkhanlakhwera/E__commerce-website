# E-Commerce Django Project

**Status: In Progress** ðŸš§  
Iâ€™m currently working on developing a full-featured e-commerce website using Django! Stay tuned for updates, as this project will soon provide a fully functional, customizable e-commerce platform for you to explore or even use as a base for your own online store.

## Project Overview

This Django project aims to offer a robust foundation for an e-commerce website, complete with essential features such as:

- **User Registration and Authentication**
- **Product Catalog** with categories and product details
- **Shopping Cart** functionality
- **Order Management** for a smooth checkout process
- **Admin Dashboard** for managing products, orders, and users

## Key Features (In Progress)

1. **Dynamic Product Listings**: Categorized product views with filtering and search capabilities.
2. **User-Friendly Cart**: Users can add, remove, or modify items in their cart and proceed to checkout.
3. **Order Tracking and History**: Registered users can view their past orders and track ongoing orders.
4. **Admin Management**: Easily manage products, orders, and user roles from a built-in Django admin panel.

## Future Plans

As development progresses, I plan to add more features, such as:

- **Payment Integration**: For real-world applications.
- **Discounts and Promotions**: Manageable through the admin dashboard.
- **Product Reviews and Ratings**: To enhance user engagement.

## Getting Started

Once the project is complete, detailed instructions will be added on how to set up and use the project on your local machine.

Stay tuned! Soon, you'll have access to a free, customizable e-commerce website template built with Django. âœ¨
